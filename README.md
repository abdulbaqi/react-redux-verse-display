This project connects with an API and displays verses in both original Arabic and English translation. I am going to use React-Redux combinations for this App.

The first step is to create the app as follows:

```
npx create-react-app react-redux-verse-display
```

Then upload to a github repository named the same `react-redux-verse-display`. 

In the local terminal:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'first'
git remote add origin https://github.com/abdulbaqi/react-redux-verse-display.git
git push -u origin master
```
